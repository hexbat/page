Hi, Sorry about the pull request, it was the only way I could contact you.

I randomly picked a repo you had that was not forked from somewhere else so I would not confuse others with this message!

So, the reason I am writing you is that

I am trying to start a new open source project with the name of HexBat.

The name is not for sure yet, its being considered!

And I was wondering if I could come to some sort of financial agreement with you, the account holder, where I could use this name on github ?

Feel free to reply to this pull request, and I will be happy to respond,

Will Woodlief
